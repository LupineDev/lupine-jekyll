  <h1>About LupineDev</h1>
  <p>Welcome to Lupine Software Development, the personal website for
  Christopher Sass.  Currently I'm working for an awesome company called
  Ikayzo.  I love Ruby, Rails, and have been known to do a little
  JavaScript from time to time.  Also have a great appreciation for
  Math, Physics and other scientific things that enthrall my
  interest.</p>

  <p>If you haven't already done so, register for the Aloha Ruby
  Conference .  You'd be a fool not to.  For now check out my blog for
  some interesting/helpful posts regarding the topics listed above.</p>

  <p>This website is using Refinery, a pretty cool Ruby on Rails powered Content Management System.  </p>
