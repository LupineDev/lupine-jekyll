  <h1>About Lupine Dev</h1>
  <p>Welcome to Lupine Software Development, the personal website for
  Christopher Sass.  Currently I'm working for an awesome company called
  Ikayzo.  I love Ruby, Rails, and have been known to do a little
  JavaScript from time to time.  Also have a great appreciation for
  Math, Physics and other scientific things that enthrall my
  interest.</p>
