Recent events like the leaking of PRISM have reinvigorated the concerns
of many for their privacy online.  This is a broad subject, and I am by
no means a security expert, but I would to talk about an easy way to
give a little control back to your users.

It's virtually impossible these days to visit a web page without seeing
several social media "share" buttons/widgets.  Making it ridiculously
easy for your users to send your page to their favourite social
twitbookfacegramsnapspace is an effective way to boost traffic and gain
visibility.  The problem with these widgets is that they are helping the
social networks [track your user's browsing history](http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-20006532-38.html) even if they don't
"like" or "share" the button on your web page. In addition to tracking
your users, it also can expose them to more [security vulnerabilities](http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-20006532-38.html) on
public wifi networks.

The speed and breadth at which information can propagate across the
social web is one of the most powerful effects of the internet. Despite
the concerns mentioned above, I still think that users should be able to
easily "share" a page on their social network(s) of choice **if they
choose to do so**. My problem with the standard widgets provided by social
networks is that they do not give users a chance to opt-out.

Enter [Social Share Privacy](http://panzi.github.io/SocialSharePrivacy/).  This is a way to put social widgets on your
site but allow your users to opt-in to them.  No data is sent to the
social network unless the user makes a conscious decision to allow it.
The way it works is the widgets are displayed but they are greyed out.
Only if the user clicks on the widget will any data be sent to the
social network. In addition to putting a small bit of privacy back in
your user's hands it also draws attention to the concerns that these
widgets present. Most users are probably unaware that the widgets are
reporting activity to the networks just by them visiting the page.
