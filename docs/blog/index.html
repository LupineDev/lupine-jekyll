        <p><p>Whatever profession you are a part of it requires some set of skills in order to accomplish.  The skill is useful, or at least someone thinks it’s valuable enough to pay you to perform it. At the beginning of your career you are learning many new things every day.  Your new job/project constantly pushes the boundaries of your experience.  As time progresses and you become able to perform your job with less assistance from mentors and co-workers. The great initial momentum at which you learn new skills and refine existing ones begins to peter out. This is not guaranteed to happen, but it gets harder to find time to really focus on improving your craft. It’s something I’ve found myself struggling with this past year.</p>

        <p><p>Most rails applications have some sort of “user” to represent either
customers who are consuming the service or administrators that are
publishing content to the web application.  It’s important that these
users are authenticated (ensuring that they are who they say they are).
For user authentication in a Ruby on Rails application, <a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/devise">Devise</a> is one of
the best solutions out there.  It has a very active community and wide
variety of options and extensions to fit your business model.  Sometimes
customers may ask for or the application requires an additional layer of
authentication beyond the basic username/password combination.</p>

        <p><p>If you have been part of building an application that has lasted longer
than a month then you’ve probably had some troubles as the project
grows.   Business logic requirements get more and more complicated.
Features change direction.  You occasionally “hack” something just to
satisfy a release or an urgent bug fix, saying “I can refactor/clean
this up this later…”</p>

        <p><p>The use of “includes(:association_name)” in rails is a widely accepted
rails best practice to prevent n + 1 queries in your views. If you
aren’t sure what either of those mean check out the ruby on rails guide
about <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html#eager-loading-associations">eager loading associations</a>.  When you are retrieving a collection
of things, this will automatically retrieve the associated object from
the database and store it into memory.   Without this rails would need to
call an extra query for each object when you call an attribute on the
association.</p>

        <p><p>For the current project I am working on we are using the
<a href="https://github.com/jnicklas/carrierwave">CarrierWave</a> gem as an upload
solution for users to upload files. It is a great solution for uploading
files to your rails that allows you to specify “versions” of uploaded
images that are cropped and/or resized to the width/height you need.
This is a great feature for creating thumbnails or other precise image
sizes that was needed for this project. Unfortunately we needed the
users to be able to have this single CarrierWave “uploader” to upload
many differenty file types of files not just images.</p>
